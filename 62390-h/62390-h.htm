<p class="drop-cap">IN a paper which I was privileged to read before this
honourable Society three years ago as to &#8220;New Lights
on Chatterton,&#8221; I mentioned incidentally that the
researches of which that paper was the outcome had
arisen out of the examination by me of a large bundle
of papers that had been collected by Bishop Percy of Dromore, the editor
of the famous <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, and had apparently remained
unexplored since his death in 1811. The Chatterton documents were
by no means the most important and were certainly the least puzzling of
the array of miscellaneous papers included in this bundle, which contained
not only a variety of notes about Shakespeare and other subjects which
had engaged the Bishop&#8217;s attention, but chiefly and most interestingly a
large quantity of original letters written by and about Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>To discuss in detail the whole of the questions arising out of these
Goldsmith papers would really amount to writing a new life of that poet,
which I have no intention of doing. There exist already many biographies
of Oliver by writers of the first rank, and no fact of salient importance
concerning himself remains to be revealed, whatever may be said as to his
writings. There are, it is true, side-lights of some literary interest and
value afforded by the papers that have come unexpectedly my way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the kindness and generosity of the great grand-daughter of the Bishop by
whose favour you have the advantage of personally inspecting the original
letters which I shall presently describe: but this is not the occasion for
minutiæ concerning them.</p>

<p>What therefore with your permission I propose now to do is to deal
only with the letters written by Oliver Goldsmith at various periods of his
life to members of his own family and old friends of his boyhood resident
in his native province, and to deduce from them some general
reflections as to the warmth of his affections and the simplicity of his
typically Irish character.</p>

<p>Thomas Percy, to whom we mainly owe the preservation of these
letters, was almost an exact contemporary of Oliver Goldsmith. The latter
was born on 10 November, 1728; Percy on 13 April, 1729. They first
met on Wednesday, 21 February, 1759, as fellow-guests of Dr. Grainger,
the author of the &#8220;Sugar Cane,&#8221; at the Temple Exchange Coffee House,
Temple Bar. Percy was then a bachelor clergyman with a college living
at Easton Maudit in Northamptonshire, but with literary associations that
kept him much in London; and Goldsmith was just emerging from the
chrysalis stage of hack-work for the reviews and was lodging in a garret
at Green Arbour Court near the Old Bailey. Percy met Goldsmith again
on 26 February, at Dodsley&#8217;s, for whom Oliver was preparing his &#8220;Enquiry
into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe,&#8221; and on Saturday,
3 March, before returning to Easton Maudit, he paid a visit to Goldsmith
at Green Arbour Court with the result expressed thus in Percy&#8217;s own
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Doctor was writing his Enquiry, etc., in a wretched dirty room
in which there was but one chair, and when he from civility offered it
to his visitant, himself was obliged to sit in the window. While they
were conversing, someone gently rapped at the door, and being desired
to come in, a poor ragged little girl of very decent behaviour, entered,
who dropping a curtsie, said &#8216;My mamma sends her compliments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
begs the favour of you to lend her a chamber-pot full of coal.&#8217;&#8221; (Percy
Memoir, p. 61.)</p>

<p>Percy was introduced by Goldsmith to Dr. Johnson on 31 May, 1761,
and the acquaintance with the great lexicographer and his literary friends
soon ripened and grew more intimate. &#8220;The Club&#8221; founded by Johnson
and Reynolds in 1764 included Goldsmith from the first: Percy and two
others were admitted to the charmed circle rather later (15 February,
1768). When Goldsmith died in April, 1774, the general impression
seems to have been that Johnson would write a biography of him for his
&#8220;Lives of the Poets&#8221;; but difficulties of one or another sort&mdash;chiefly
perhaps Johnson&#8217;s inertia, for he was then a man of 65&mdash;intervened to
prevent this: and eleven years afterwards, when Johnson himself was dead,
Percy was stimulated by Edmond Malone to undertake the task himself.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that he had in his own mind long before this
that something of the kind might have to be done by him, for there is
evidence in the papers confided to me for examination that Percy had
commissioned an inpecunious younger brother of the poet named Maurice
Goldsmith to collect for him all the procurable letters written by Oliver
to members of his family.</p>

<p>The biographers and commentators on Goldsmith have made much
of an extract from a letter from Percy to Malone which is printed on
page 237 of Vol. VIII (1858) of Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary Illustrations</i>; but they
have been unaware of the letter from Malone to which it is a reply. This
original letter of Malone is amongst those in the bundle which I have
been exploring. It is dated from London on 2 March, 1785, and gives
some interesting particulars as to Johnson&#8217;s affairs. The essential parts
as to Goldsmith are as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after the death of poor Dr. Johnson, I mentioned to one of
the executors that I had formerly given him a letter from Dr. Wilson,
a fellow of the college of Dublin, relative to Dr. Goldsmith, who was
his classfellow. I did not then know Dr. Johnson as well as I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
afterwards, and improvidently gave him the original instead of a copy.
I therefore requested, if it should be found among his papers, it might
be sent to me. I suppose Dr. Scott, to whom I talked on the subject,
did not exactly recollect what I had mentioned, for about a fortnight
ago, a parcel of papers was sent to me marked at the outside
&#8216;Dr. Goldsmith,&#8217; as I imagine from the Executors (for I received no
note with them), who conceived they belonged to me. On inspecting
them, I found they consisted of some very curious materials collected
by your Lordship for the life of Goldsmith, which I shall take great care
of till I hear from you on the subject. I often pressed Dr. Johnson
to write his life, and he would have done so, had not the booksellers
from some clashing of interests in the property of his works excluded
them from their great collection of English Poetry. It is a great pity
that these materials should be lost. Why will not your lordship, who
knew Goldsmith so well, undertake the arranging of them.... Dr. J.
used to say that he never could get an accurate account of Goldsmith&#8217;s
history while he was abroad.... Goldsmith&#8217;s letters are surely characteristick
and worth preserving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Percy no doubt asked for this bundle of papers to be sent to him in
Ireland; and when it was received, he wrote from Dublin on 16 June,
1785, the letter to Malone which, as stated above, is printed in Vol. VIII
of Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary Illustrations</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have long owed you my very grateful acknowledgments for a
most obliging letter, which contained much interesting information,
particularly with respect to Goldsmith&#8217;s memoirs. The paper which
you have recovered in my own handwriting, giving dates and many
interesting particulars relating to his life, was dictated to me by himself
one rainy day at Northumberland House, and sent by me to Dr. Johnson,
which I had concluded to be irrevocably lost. The other memoranda
on the subject were transmitted to me by his brother and others of
his family, to afford materials for a Life of Goldsmith, which Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was to write and publish for their benefit. But he utterly forgot them
and the subject.... Goldsmith has an only brother living, a cabinet
maker, who has been a decent tradesman, a very honest worthy man,
but he has been very unfortunate, and is at this time in great indigence.
It has occurred to such of us here as were acquainted with the Doctor
to print an edition of his poems, chiefly under the direction of the
Bishop of Killaloe<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and myself, and prefix a new correct life of
the author, for the poor man&#8217;s benefit; and to get you and Sir Joshua
Reynolds, Mr. Steevens, etc., to recommend the same in England, especially
among the members of The Club. If we can but subsist this poor
man at present, and relieve him from immediate indigence, Mr. Orde,
our Secretary of State, has given us hope that he will procure him some
little place that will make him easy for life; and then we shall have
shown our regard for the departed Bard by relieving his only brother,
and so far as I hear, the only one of his family that wants relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>A scheme for publication of Goldsmith&#8217;s <i>Poetical Works</i> was set on
foot in Dublin about this time, as appears from the following printed
document found amongst the Bishop&#8217;s papers:</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Dublin, June 1, 1785.</p>

<p>&#8220;PROPOSALS for Printing by Subscription, The Poetical Works of
Dr. Oliver Goldsmith; For the Benefit of his only surviving Brother,
Mr. Maurice Goldsmith, to which will be prefixed, <small>A NEW LIFE OF THE
AUTHOR</small>. In this will be Corrected Innumerable Errors of Former
Biographers, From Original Letters of the Doctor and his Friends, but
Chiefly from An Account of Dr. Goldsmith&#8217;s Life, Dictated by Himself
to A Gentleman, who is in Possession of the Manuscript.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subscription price was to be a guinea, and subscriptions would
be received by the publisher, L. White, No. 86, Dame Street. What
happened to the money received for the subscriptions is not known;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
probably Maurice Goldsmith drew cash &#8220;on account&#8221; for most of it.
Anyhow the book was never published.</p>

<p>If it had been set about at once, and been limited as proposed to
Goldsmith&#8217;s <i>Poetical Works</i>, and a Life of him compiled from the original
materials collected by Percy, it would doubtless have been a success. As
it was, the Bishop&#8217;s episcopal duties and other preoccupations appear
to have disinclined him to undertake the work himself, and he therefore
placed it in other hands, with very unfortunate results to himself and
to those members of the Goldsmith family for whose benefit it was
intended. Maurice Goldsmith no doubt told his relatives of the pecuniary
advantages that were in store for him when the work came out, and
appeals for help reached the Bishop from the daughter of Henry Goldsmith,
from the widow of Maurice, from Charles Goldsmith, and from a son of
Charles named John Goldsmith. In the absence of the published work
these appeals had to be met out of the Bishop&#8217;s private purse, and involved
him in much distressing correspondence with the impoverished relatives
of his dead friend.</p>

<p>At what period Percy formed the idea of expanding the publication
so as to include all Goldsmith&#8217;s known works&mdash;prose as well as poetry&mdash;is
not clear. Probably he was more concerned to see the Life written
or at least in preparation. It must be remembered that he was exceedingly
badly placed for now attempting work of this kind. He was in a remote
part of Ireland where the posts were irregular and the magazines did not
reach him till months after their issue. Writing to Malone on 16 June,
1785, he said: &#8220;I see publications about as soon as they would reach the
East Indies.&#8221; (<i>Lit. Ill.</i>, VIII, 237.)</p>

<p>He seems to have attempted to shift the burden of compilation of the
biography on to a somewhat fulsome correspondent, Dr. Thomas Campbell,
Rector of Clones. When, after a long interval, Campbell&#8217;s efforts proved
unsatisfactory, the Bishop tried as collaborator the Rev. E. H. Boyd, the
translator of Dante, with equally disappointing results, Boyd, like Campbell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
having no personal knowledge of Goldsmith. Eventually he had to set to
work himself on a thorough revision; but troubles arose after he had sent
the manuscript to the publishers in London (Cadell &amp; Davies). Evidently
that firm, to give local colour to the narrative, got Samuel Rose to add some
particulars about Goldsmith (not always complimentary) from Boswell&#8217;s <i>Life
of Johnson</i>. Percy, who was not consulted, dissented from these &#8220;interpolations,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and eventually repudiated all responsibility for the work, which
did not actually see the light of day until it appeared in four volumes in
1801. Percy let his correspondents who wrote to him about Goldsmith
know how badly he was being treated, and they replied softly to him,
except George Steevens, who wrote on 9 September, 1797:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus my Lord, you are left to make the best of your bargain; for if
you cannot intimidate you must submit. It is true that the works of
Goldsmith will always be sought after; but with equal truth it may be
observed that in this kingdom you will discover little zeal to promote the
welfare of his needy relatives, hundreds of objects here having a superior
claim to publick charity.&#8221; (<i>Litt. Ill.</i>, VII, 1848, pp. 30-1.)</p>

<p>After Percy&#8217;s death in 1811 the major part of his voluminous correspondence
with literary and other friends appears to have descended to his
elder daughter Barbara, who had married in 1795 Mr. Samuel Isted, of
Ecton, Northamptonshire. It probably consisted not so much of Percy&#8217;s
own letters, which were doubtless retained in most cases by their recipients,
as of his correspondents&#8217; letters to him, with drafts of his replies to the
more important of them. John Nichols, the antiquarian printer who
managed the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>, was a great friend and frequent
correspondent of Percy, and the sixth volume (1831) of the well-known
<i>Literary Illustrations</i> contained a short memoir and portrait of Percy,
with a selection of his letters partly derived from William Upcott, Assistant
Librarian of the London Institution (p. viii of Introduction). The 856
pages of the next Volume VII of the <i>Illustrations</i>, which was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
published till seventeen years later (1848), were practically entirely devoted
to letters from and to Percy&mdash;mostly the latter. This correspondence,
according to the &#8220;Advertisement&#8221; by J. B. Nichols, the editor, &#8220;was not
in my possession at the completion of the sixth volume, but has been
acquired since by public sale.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Even this huge book did not contain all
the Percy letters, for the eighth and final volume of the <i>Illustrations</i>, not
published till 1858, was, so far as the letterpress (436 pages) is concerned,
wholly taken up with the rest of the &#8220;Percy correspondence.&#8221; There are
many references to Goldsmith and to the long-delayed &#8220;Memoir&#8221; of 1801
in these letters, but nothing of great importance, and I therefore have to
fall back on the bundle of &#8220;Goldsmithiana&#8221; which has happily been
preserved in the other branch of the Percy family&mdash;the Meades.</p>

<p>The story of the incubation, preparation and final publication of the
Edition of 1801 is long, complicated and tedious. It does not however
particularly concern us here, except in so far as we are indebted to
Bishop Percy for having collected practically all the original letters written
by Goldsmith to members of his family, and for having in his disappointment
after they were published, put them away with the other documents
concerning the publication, in a bundle which has been practically
unexplored ever since. Setting aside therefore any questions as to the
merits or demerits of what has been consistently labelled by subsequent
commentators as the &#8220;Percy Memoir,&#8221; we are left with the consideration
of the point to which I had intended to address myself exclusively, the
epistolary style of Oliver Goldsmith himself. Percy could not resist the
temptation of editing his friend&#8217;s letters&mdash;not much, it is true, but still
enough to induce us to turn to the originals, as we are now enabled to
do through the kindness of their present possessor, Miss Constance
Meade.</p>

<p>Now whilst Percy, as I have indicated, was an ardent and industrious
letter writer, Oliver Goldsmith emphatically was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>One of Percy&#8217;s most frequent correspondents, James Grainger, M.D.
(1724-1766), who was, as already mentioned, the first to introduce Percy
and Goldsmith to each other, wrote to the former on 24 March, 1764:
&#8220;When I taxed little Goldsmith for not writing as he promised me, his
answer was that he never wrote a letter in his life, and faith, I believe
him, except to a bookseller for money.&#8221; (Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary Illustrations</i>,
Vol. VII, 286.) The letters written by Goldsmith to members of his
family and Irish friends of his youth which were collected from various
quarters at the instance of Percy after the poet&#8217;s death show him to have
had a great power of expressing his feelings in simple and moving language,
all the more interesting as the writer could not possibly have imagined
that they would ever be seen in the cold light of print. Such letters
divide themselves naturally into three categories, viz.: those written (1)
whilst he was a student in Scotland and abroad; (2) after he had returned
to England and was a struggling hack-writer; (3) when he had achieved
success in the literary world. It will be convenient to consider these
three series of letters separately.</p>


<h3>STUDENT LETTERS.</h3>

<p>I omit from consideration the letter Oliver is alleged, on no evidence
at all, to have written to his mother in 1751 after his adventures in
Ireland and attempted voyage to America. This is obviously a hash-up
by some later pen of the story which was written out after the poet&#8217;s death
by his sister Mrs. Catherine Hodson for the purposes of the &#8220;Percy
Memoir,&#8221; the original of which in Mrs. Hodson&#8217;s own writing and spelling
is among the papers which I exhibit. The earliest of Goldsmith&#8217;s own
letters which is known to have survived was that written from Edinburgh
by Oliver to his benefactor Uncle Contarine on 8 May, 1753. This
was unearthed by Sir James Prior at a later period of his investigations,
having been &#8220;long though vainly sought in various quarters,&#8221; and is
published in his Vol. I, 1837, pp. 145-7. What has happened to it since
I have not been able to discover. Oliver describes in it his progress with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his medical studies, and winds up thus: &#8220;How I enjoy the pleasing hope
of returning with skill, and to find my friends stand in no need of my
assistance! How many happy years do I wish you! and nothing but
want of health can take from you happiness, since you so well pursue
the paths that conduct to virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is another letter of about the same period addressed by Oliver
from Edinburgh to his brother-in-law, Daniel Hodson of Lissoy, of which
only a fragment now exists. It was formerly in the Rowfant collection
of the late Mr. Locker-Lampson, but now belongs to Mr. F. R. Halsey
of New York. In it Oliver speaks of his attending the public lectures:
&#8220;I am in my lodging. I have hardly any society but a folio book, a
skeleton, my cat and my meagre landlady. I read hard, which is a thing
I never could do when the study was displeasing.&#8221; He refers to his
impecunious position and to the sacrifices his relations had made on his
behalf. He asks his dear Dan to remember him to every friend. &#8220;There
is one on whom I never think without affliction, but conceal it from him.&#8221;
(This apparently refers to Uncle Contarine). &#8220;Direct to me at Surgeon
Sinclairs in the Trunk Close, Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next letter of this student series is to his school-friend and
companion, Robert Bryanton of Ballymahon, dated from Edinburgh
&#8220;Sepr. ye 26th 1753.&#8221; The original of this letter is the earliest in point
of date which I am able to exhibit to you this afternoon. Oliver
commences by a humorous apology for not having written before. &#8220;I
might allege that business had never given me time to finger a pen: but
I suppress those and twenty others equally plausible and as easily
invented, since they might all be attended with a slight inconvenience
of being known to be lies. Let me then speak truth: an hereditary
indolence (I have it from the mother&#8217;s side) has hitherto prevented my
writing to you, and still prevents my writing at least twenty five letters
more, due to my friends in Ireland: no turn-spit dog gets up into his
wheel with more reluctance than I sit down to write: yet no dog ever
loved the roast meat he turns better than I do him I now address.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>This letter was a long one, with clever references to the Scottish
scenery and people, the relations of the sexes, the characteristics of the
Scotch women, and other light hearted topics. It was published by Percy
in the Edition of 1801, with a number of genteel emendations, such as
&#8220;mouth puckered up so as scarcely to admit a pea&#8221; in replacement of
&#8220;mouth puckered up to the size of an Issue,&#8221; and the omission of the
last paragraph and also the postscript: &#8220;Give my sincere regards (not
compliments do you mind) to your agreeable family, and give my service
to my mother if you see her: for as you express it in Ireland, I have a
sneaking kindness for her still. Direct to me, Student of Physick in
Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next letter in order of date is a second one to Uncle Contarine,
not dated but ascribed to the close of 1753 or January, 1754. It was
retrieved by Prior for his Life of 1837 (I, 154), but its present whereabouts
is unknown. It announces Oliver&#8217;s intention to go to France in the
following February, to spend the spring and summer in Paris, and go to
Leyden at the beginning of the next winter. He sends his earnest love
to his cousin Jenny (Mrs. Lawder) and her husband, asks after &#8220;my poor
Jack&#8221; (doubtless his youngest brother), and describes himself as &#8220;dear
Uncle, Your most devoted Oliver Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next letter is an important and very interesting one, and describes
Oliver&#8217;s compulsory change of plans. It was sent from Leyden some time
in the summer of 1754, and is written on three pages of a foolscap sheet
of unusually large size, 15 &times; 9&frac34; inches. The fourth page has, as you
will see, this address upon it: &#8220;To &#124; the Revd. Mr. Thos. Contarine, at
Kilmore near &#124; Carrick on Shannon in Ireland,&#8221; with the words added
&#8220;This letter is chargd. 1s. 8d.&#8221; It appears therefrom that he embarked
from Edinburgh on board a Scotch ship bound for Bordeaux and that a
storm drove them into Newcastle, where he was arrested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven men and me were one day on shore, and the following
evening, as we were all verry merry, the room door bursts open; enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a Sergeant and Twelve Grenadiers with their bayonets screwd, and puts
us all under the King&#8217;s arrest. It seems my Company were Scotch men
in the French service. I endeavoured all I could to prove my innocence:
however, I remained in prison with the rest a Fortnight and with difficulty
got off even then. Dr. Sr. keep this all a secret, or at least say
it was for debt: for it were once known at the university I should hardly
get a degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>As to his future movements, Goldsmith says in this letter from Leyden:</p>

<p>&#8220;Physic is by no means taught so well as in Edinburgh.... I am not
certain how long my stay here will be: however I expect to have the
happiness of seeing you at Kidmore, if I can, next March.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oliver describes in much humorous detail the scenery of the country
and characteristics of the Dutch people. He says:</p>

<p>&#8220;The downright Hollander is one of the oddest figures in Nature.
Upon a head of lank hair he wears a half-cockd narrow-leav&#8217;d hat, lacd
with black ribon: no coat but seven waistcoats and nine pairs of
breeches so that his hips reach almost up to his arm-pits. This well
cloathed vegetable is now fit to see company or make love: but what a
pleasing creature is the object of his appetite: why she wears a large
friez cap with a deal of flanders lace and for every pair of breeches he
carries, she puts on two petticoats. Is it not surprizing how things
shoud ever come close enough to make it a match?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bishop Percy prints the whole of this letter, except that he delicately
bowdlerised one or two phrases in it, and from the Percy version it has
reappeared in every one of the succeeding biographies.</p>


<h3>EARLY LETTERS FROM LONDON.</h3>

<p>The second series of letters begins after Oliver had returned to
England about a couple of years, and was &#8220;by a very little practice as
a physician and a very little reputation as a poet making a shift to live,&#8221;
as he describes it in a letter to his brother-in-law Daniel Hodson, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
from the Temple Exchange Coffee House, on 27 December, 1757. His
brother Charles Goldsmith had paid Oliver a visit in London, and had
informed him &#8220;of the fatigue you were at in soliciting a subscription to
relieve me, not only among my friends and relations, but acquaintance
in general. Tho my pride might feel some repugnance at being thus
relieved, yet my gratitude can suffer no diminution.... Whether I eat or
starve, live in a first floor or four pairs of stairs high, I still remember
them [my friends] with ardour, nay my very country comes in for a share
of my affection. Unaccountable fondness for country, this maladie du
Pays, as the french call it.&#8221; He hopes that if he can be absent six weeks
from London next summer &#8220;to spend three of them among my friends
in Ireland. My design is purely to visit, and neither to cut a figure nor
levy contributions&mdash;neither to excite envy nor solicit favour: in fact my
circumstances are adapted to neither. I am too poor to be gazed at,
and too rich to need assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Percy here omits what he calls &#8220;some mention of private family
matters.&#8221; The letter is at this point frayed and imperfect, but these
words can be made out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles is furnished with everything necessary, but why ... stranger
to assist him. I hope he will be improved in his ... against his
return [from Jamaica]. Poor Jenny! But it is what I expected. My
mother too has lost Pallas! My dear Sir, these things give me real
uneasiness, and I could wish to redress them. But at present there is
hardly a Kingdom in Europe in which I am not a debtor&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>After an interval, Goldsmith had what was for him a real bout of
letter-writing to a number of his kinsfolk and friends, to solicit their
assistance in getting subscriptions for his &#8220;Enquiry into the Present State
of Polite Learning in Europe&#8221; on which he was engaged, and which
was about to be published. On 7 August, 1758, he wrote to his cousin
and school-fellow Edward Mills that his &#8220;Essay on the Present State of
Taste and Literature in Europe,&#8221; as it was then called, was &#8220;now printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in London, and I have requested Mr. Radcliff, Mr. Lawder, Mr. Bryanton,
my brother Mr. Henry Goldsmith, and my brother-in-law Mr. Hodson,
to circulate my proposals among their acquaintances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter to Dr. Radcliff is unknown: the date of that to Mrs.
Lawder, asking her husband&#8217;s help, is 15 August, 1758; that to Bryanton
is 14 August, 1758; the letter to Henry Goldsmith is lost, but a second
letter to him on the same subject says &#8220;I shall the beginning of next
month send over two hundred and fifty books.&#8221; As the work was
published on 2 April, 1759, the date of this second letter to the Revd.
Henry Goldsmith was probably February, 1759. (It has been preserved,
but is not actually dated.)</p>

<p>Taking these several communications in the order of their date, the
letter of 7 August, 1758, to Edward Mills, which I exhibit to-day, is a
frank appeal for help in circulating the prospectus of Oliver&#8217;s new book,
but otherwise contains nothing of importance. &#8220;Every book published
here [London] the printers in Ireland republish there, without giving the
Author the least consideration for his coppy. I would in this respect
disappoint their avarice, and have all the additional advantages that may
result from the sale of my performance there to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Mills nor Lawder (to whom a similar request was made
through the medium of his wife on the 15th of the same month of
August, 1758) appears to have taken any notice of it, and in writing to
his brother Henry at a later date&mdash;about February, 1759&mdash;Oliver says
&#8220;The behaviour of Mr. Mills and Mr. Lawder is a little extraordinary:
however, their answering neither you nor me is a sufficient indication of
their disliking the employment which I assignd them. As their conduct
is different from what I had expected so I have made an alteration in
mine. I shall the beginning of next month send over two hundred and
fifty books, which are all that I fancy, can be well sold among you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next letter, that dated 14 August, 1758, addressed to Robert
Bryanton is only known to us through its appearance for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in Prior&#8217;s <i>Life</i> (I, 263). It complains of not having heard from Bryanton
or of his doings, gives an amusing prophecy of his own future fame 200
years onwards as the author of the Essay on Polite Learning &#8220;a work
well worth its weight in diamonds,&#8221; and then descends suddenly to earth
with &#8220;Oh! Gods! Gods! here in a garret writing for bread and
expecting to be dunned for a milk-score! However, dear Bob, whether
in penury or affluence, serious or gay, I am ever thine. Give the most
warm and sincere wish you can conceive to your mother, Mrs. Bryanton,
to Miss Bryanton, to yourself: and if there be a favourite dog in the
family, let me be remembered to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter to Mrs. Lawder of 15 August, 1758, is a good deal more
guarded, as his relations with his cousin and her husband appear not to
have been at that time of a very cordial nature. The original has passed
through several hands, and has been reproduced more than once in
facsimile. I believe it is now the property of Mr. Sabin of Bond Street.
Oliver says he had written to Kilmore (Mrs. Lawder&#8217;s address) from
Leyden, from Louvain and from Rouen, but had received no answer.
&#8220;To what could I attribute this, please, but displeasure or forgetfulness?&#8221;...
&#8220;I heartily wish to be rich, if it were only for this reason to say
without a blush how much I esteem you, but alas I have many a fatigue
to encounter, before that happy time comes: when your poor old simple
friend may again give a loose to the luxuriance of his nature, sitting by
Kilmore fireside, recount the various adventures of an hard-fought life,
laugh over the follies of the day, join his flute to your harpsicord and
forget that he ever starv&#8217;d in those streets where Butler and Otway
starv&#8217;d before him.&#8221; After a pathetic allusion to the decaying mental
powers of his uncle Contarine, Oliver then makes his appeal as to the
&#8220;Polite Learning,&#8221; but &#8220;whether this request is complied with or not,
I shall not be uneasy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second letter to Daniel Hodson, which I exhibit, is provisionally
dated by the modern authorities about November, 1758. It was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
by Percy in the edition of 1801, with the family matters omitted, and some
few alterations and excisions. The letter really begins &#8220;You can&#8217;t expect
regularity in <i>a correspondence with</i> one who is regular in nothing.&#8221; Later,
Goldsmith says: &#8220;You imagine, I suppose, that every author by profession
lives in a garret, wears shabby cloaths and converses with the meanest
company; <i>but I assure you such a character is</i> entirely chimerical.&#8221; The
family matters omitted by Percy may as well be restored:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very much pleasd with the accounts you send me of your little
son; if I do not mistake that was his hand which subscrib&#8217;d itself
Gilbeen Hardly. There is nothing could please me more than a letter
filld with all the news of the country, but I fear you will think that too
troublesome, you see I never cease writing till a whole sheet of paper is
wrote out. I beg you will immitate me in this particular and give your
letters good measure. You can tell me, what visits you receive or pay,
who has been married or debauch&#8217;d, since my absence, what fine girls
you have starting up and beating of the veterans of my acquaintance
from future conquest. I suppose before I return I shall find all the
blooming virgins I once left in Westmeath shrivelled into a parcel of
hags with seven children apiece tearing down their petticoats. Most of
the Bucks and Bloods whom I left hunting and drinking and swearing
and getting bastards I find are dead. Poor devils they kick&#8217;d the world
before them. I wonder what the devil they kick now.&#8221; [End of first
sheet of letter.]</p>

<p>On a fresh sheet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Sister I wrote to Kilmore [where the Lawders lived]. I wish
you would let me know how that family stands affected with regard
to me. My Brother Charles promised to tell me all about it but his
letter gave me no satisfaction in those particulars. I beg you and Dan
would put your hands to the oar and fill me a sheet with somewhat
or other, if you can&#8217;t get quite thro your selves lend Billy or Nancy
the pen and let the dear little things give me their nonsense. Talk all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
about your selves and nothing about me. You see I do so. I do not
know how my desire of seeing Ireland which had so long slept, has again
revived with so much ardour....&#8221; &#8220;I ... brother Charles is settled
to business. I see no probability of ... any other proceeding.&#8221; [Here
follow sixteen lines of writing, which have been very effectually blotted out
with ink of another tint, probably by the recipient, who sent the letter to
be read by a neighbour.]</p>

<p>The letter ends thus (it is not signed):</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray let me hear from my Mother since she will not gratify me herself
and tell me if in any thing I can be immediately serviceable to her. Tell
me how my Brother Goldsmith and his Bishop agree. Pray do this for
me for heaven knows I would do anything to serve you.&#8221; [ends.]</p>

<p>The back page is blank, except the address in Goldsmith&#8217;s writing:
&#8220;Daniel Hodson Esq<sup>r</sup>. at Lishoy near &#124; Ballymahon &#124; Ireland.&#8221;</p>

<p>We come now to the one letter to his brother the Revd. Henry
Goldsmith which has been preserved. It bears no date, and was doubtless
written about February, 1759. After speaking about the &#8220;Polite
Learning&#8221; book, Oliver goes on to describe his own difficulties:</p>

<p>&#8220;You scarce can conceive how much eight years of disappointment
anguish and study have worn me down. Imagine to yourself a pale
melancholly visage with two great wrinkles between the eye-brows,
with an eye disgustingly severe and a big wig, and you may have a
perfect picture of my present appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then discusses and approves as judicious and convincing his
brother&#8217;s proposals for &#8220;breeding up your son as a scholar.&#8221; &#8220;Preach
then my dear Sir, to your son not the excellence of human nature nor the
disrespect of riches, but endeavour to teach him thrift and economy. Let
his poor wandering uncle&#8217;s example be placed in his eyes. I had learned
from books to love virtue before I was taught from experience the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
necessity of being selfish.&#8221; (The Percy Memoir of 1801 prunes and
waters down this passage.)</p>

<p>After references to his mother and other members of the family,
Oliver mentions the imminent publication of his &#8220;catchpenny&#8221; life of
Voltaire, which has brought him in £20, and quotes some phrases of the
&#8220;heroicomical poem&#8221; on the design of which he had asked his brother&#8217;s
opinion in a previous letter (now lost).</p>

<p>These are the well-known lines commencing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The window, patch&#8217;d with paper lent a ray,</div>
<div class="verse">That feebly show&#8217;d the state in which he lay</div>
</div></div>

<p>with the subsequent references to the &#8220;sanded floor&#8221; the &#8220;humid wall&#8221;
the game of goose, &#8220;the twelve rules the royal martyr drew,&#8221; etc. These
lines with a different setting reappeared in Letter XXX of the Citizen of
the World, which first appeared in the <i>Public Ledger</i> for 2 May, 1760,
and some of them were worked afterwards into lines 227-36 of the
Deserted Village, 1770, where they are improved by the addition of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;The Chest contriv&#8217;d a double debt to pay</div>
<div class="verse">A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Following his usual practice when he does set to work on a letter,
Oliver writes on to the extreme bottom of the page, and finishes thus:
&#8220;I am resolved to leave no space, tho I should fill it up only by telling
you what you very well know already, I mean that I am your most
affectionate friend and brother, Oliver Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>


<h3>LATER LETTERS.</h3>

<p>There is now a long gap in the letters to his family, only in fact broken
by two communications, one to his nephew Henry dated 7 June, 1768,
condoling with him on the death of his father the Revd. Henry, and the
other to his own brother Maurice despatched about January, 1770, in
response to the latter&#8217;s request for financial assistance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>The first of these two letters has only just come to light, having been
recently purchased through a dealer who got it from Nova Scotia by
Mr. William Harris Arnold of Nutley, New Jersey, U.S.A., to whose
kindness I owe a transcript of it. It is a letter of deep feeling at the
death of his brother, and contains a promise to help the nephew if
possible.</p>

<p>The second letter to Maurice Goldsmith&mdash;the last of the series on
which I propose to comment&mdash;makes over to him a legacy of £15 which
Uncle Contarine had left to Oliver in his will, and regrets his inability
to help Maurice further. &#8220;I am not fond of thinking of the necessities
of those I love, when it is so very little in my power to help them. I am
sorry to find you are still every way unprovided for, and what adds to my
uneasiness is that I have received a letter from my sister Johnson by
which I learn that she is pretty much in the same circumstances.&#8221; It is
true that the King has made him Professor of Ancient History to the
newly established Royal Academy of Arts (1768), &#8220;but there is no salary
annexed, and I took it rather as a compliment to the institution than any
benefit to myself. Honours to one in my situation are something like
ruffles to a man that wants a shirt.&#8221; Oliver sends kind messages to
members of the family, and asks specifically for particulars about them.
&#8220;A sheet of paper occasionally filled with news of this kind would make
me very happy and would keep you nearer my mind. As it is my dear
brother believe me to be Yours most affectionately, Oliver Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remaining letters printed in the Percy Memoir do not concern
Goldsmith&#8217;s family, but it may be mentioned incidentally that they are
all in the bundle of Goldsmithiana left by the Bishop. They are (1) a
letter to Sir Joshua Reynolds written from France in 1770 when Oliver
acted as escort to Mrs. Horneck and her two charming daughters the
Jessamy Bride and Little Comedy. (2) A letter by Goldsmith to Bennet
Langton dated 7 September, 1771 (with, it may be added, the letter from
Langton&mdash;not printed in the Memoir&mdash;to which it is a reply). (3) Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to Goldsmith from General Oglethorp (no date), Thomas Paine (21 December,
1772), John Oakman (a begging letter in verse, dated 27 March,
1773), and other miscellanea.</p>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.</h3>

<p>I should be sorry if I left you with the impression that the letters from
which I have been reading extracts were the only original documents
connected with the poet and his works included in Dr. Percy&#8217;s manuscript
bundle of &#8220;Goldsmithiana.&#8221; The contrary is the case: but the time
available to me this afternoon is too short to enable me to discuss the
various interesting points that they raise. I feel, however, I must refer
in the briefest manner possible to some miscellaneous papers of different
kinds which I found therein relating to the preliminaries for and the
production of that delightful and ever-fresh comedy of &#8220;She Stoops to
Conquer,&#8221; first given to the world on Monday, 15 March, 1773. There are
a letter from the Prompter dated &#8220;Sunday evening&#8221; (no doubt 14 March,
1773), saying he had taken the necessary steps for changing the name
of the play from &#8220;The Mistakes of a Night&#8221;; orders for boxes for
subsequent performances; requests for free seats; congratulations and
criticism on its success; a full account in Percy&#8217;s writing of Goldsmith&#8217;s
personal chastisement of Evans the bookseller for Kenrick&#8217;s malicious
article in the <i>London Packet</i> of Wednesday, 24 March, 1773 (endorsed
in the Bishop&#8217;s hand &#8220;The termination of the affray with Evans, as first
intended, but afterwards altered out of tenderness to Dr. G&#8217;s Memory&#8221;);
a printed copy of the <i>London Packet</i> of Friday, 26 March, containing its
own account of the encounter with Evans; George Coleman&#8217;s original
letter of 23 March, 1773, begging Goldsmith to &#8220;take him off the rack
of the newspapers&#8221;; manuscript copies (not in Goldsmith&#8217;s writing) of
two rejected Epilogues to the play; and other documents of great human
interest.</p>

<p>As I have consistently tried in this address to avoid indulging in
theories, and to limit myself to demonstrable facts, I refrain from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
discussion as to why these documents of 1773 are in such force in the
resuscitated bundle of Percy papers, whereas there are comparatively few
and scattered documents of earlier date. I should not, however, be
surprised if Goldsmith, dreading that the commotion caused and public
comment excited by his scuffle with Evans might involve him in further
disagreeable consequences, had himself collected these papers and consulted
Percy personally thereon, with the result that they remained in
the latter&#8217;s custody.</p>

<p>When nearly a quarter of a century later, Percy put his hand to the
preparation of the Memoir of his friend, he may have thought that the
discreditable incidents obscuring the memory of a great public success
were best buried in oblivion; and he therefore confined himself in the
published work to the statement that &#8220;She Stoops to Conquer&#8221; &#8220;added
very much to the author&#8217;s reputation, and brought down upon him a
torrent of congratulatory addresses and petitions from less fortunate
bards whose indigence compelled them to solicit his bounty, and of
scurrilous abuse from such of them, as being less reduced, only envied
his success.&#8221; (<i>Memoir</i>, p. 101.)</p>

<p>Percy could not, it is true, resist the temptation of placing on record in
the Memoir &#8220;Tom Tickle&#8217;s&#8221; attack on Goldsmith in the <i>London Packet</i>:
but, says he, &#8220;we would not defile our page with this scurrilous production,
so shall insert it in the margin.&#8221; (pp. 103-5, notes.)</p>

<p>It seems to me not unlikely that Percy&#8217;s opinion was sought as to
the wording of the defence or disclaimer by Goldsmith &#8220;To the Public&#8221;
which appeared in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of 31 March, 1773, as this also is
printed <i>in extenso</i> in the Memoir of 1801 (pp. 107-8). Dr. Johnson had
certainly no hand in its preparation, for on Saturday, 3 April, in response
to an enquiry by the obsequious Boswell, he said: &#8220;Sir, Dr. Goldsmith
would no more have asked me to have wrote such a thing as that for him,
than he would have asked me to feed him with a spoon, or to do anything
else that denoted imbecility.... He has indeed done it very well, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
it is a foolish thing well done.&#8221; Percy says in the Memoir (p. 107): &#8220;The
subject of this dispute was long discussed in the public papers, which
discanted on the impropriety of attacking a man in his own house: and an
action was threatened for the assault: which was at length compromised&#8221;:
and here he leaves it, as we may well do.</p>

<p>One other matter connected with &#8220;She Stoops to Conquer&#8221; I must
ask your permission to touch upon before I conclude. Four attempts were
made at an Epilogue for the play, and the Percy documents enable us for
the first time to understand the sequence of these. Two of them were
printed (not quite textually) in Vol. II of the Memoir of 1801, and Percy,
who set great store by them, complains to his correspondents that enough
credit was not given to him by the publishers for them. He told
Dr. Robert Anderson:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Dr. had likewise given him two original Poems that had never
been printed. These are the two Epilogues printed in the second
Volume, viz: that spoken by Mrs. Bulkley and Miss Catley, and that
intended for Mrs. Bulkley. The latter [it] is said in a Note, was given
in Manuscript to Dr. Percy by the Author, but no such mention is made
of the former, tho&#8217; it was also so given by him and delivered to the
Publishers in his own writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Percy was a little in doubt about the second of these Epilogues (which
in the edition of 1801 he cut down from 58 lines to 42), for he invited
George Steevens on 10 September, 1797, to ask Mrs. Bulkley if she
remembered for what play it was intended: &#8220;He [Goldsmith] gave it me
among a parcel of letters and papers, some written by himself, and some
addressed to him, but with not much explanation&#8221; (<i>Literary Illustrations</i>,
VII, 31). Steevens&#8217; reply of 14 September, 1797, was in his usual caustic
vein: &#8220;The lady you would have interrogated ceased to be at least seven
years ago: and what would the public say could it be known that your
Lordship, a Protestant Bishop, was desirous to send your sober correspondents
into the other world a harlot-hunting?&#8221; (<i>Ibid</i>, 32).</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>It is a little surprising that the Bishop should not have at once
recognised its obvious associations with &#8220;She Stoops to Conquer,&#8221; in
view of the two lines at the end of the Epilogue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;No high-life scenes, no sentiment: the creature</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Still stoops among the low to copy nature.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But all these points, in their way interesting and even absorbing, are rather
beyond the object with which I embarked upon this paper, viz.: to do
justice to the affectionate side of Goldsmith&#8217;s warm Irish nature by
bringing into relief the letters which, despite his repugnance to correspondence,
he from time to time addressed to members of his own family
with ardent and even pitiful appeals for news from Ireland. These
appeals, it is to be feared, had no satisfactory response from the recipients
of the letters which after their many adventures I have now had the
privilege of exhibiting to you, and which I think serve to illustrate the
truth of Dr. Johnson&#8217;s dictum: &#8220;Goldsmith was a man of such variety
of powers and such felicity of performance, that he always seemed to
do best that which he was doing: a man who had the art of being
minute without tediousness, and general without confusion; whose
language was copious without exuberance, exact without constraint and
easy without weakness.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX.</h2></div>

<p class="center"><i>Biographical particulars as to the members of Oliver Goldsmith&#8217;s family,
partly from unpublished sources.</i></p>


<p>Oliver Goldsmith died on 4 April, 1774. Although there was some
talk of a biography of him being undertaken by Johnson, it appears to
have become a common understanding, soon after the death, amongst the
members of The Club and their associates that the work of collecting and
preparing the materials for the biography would be done by Thomas Percy.
At that time Percy had achieved a certain reputation in literary circles,
but was by no means the important person in the ecclesiastical sense that
he afterwards became. He was then mainly resident in London as
Chaplain and Secretary to the Duke of Northumberland and as one of the
Chaplains of the King. It was not until 1778 that he was made Dean
of Carlisle, from which position he was promoted in 1782 to the Bishopric
of Dromore in Ireland.</p>

<p>Percy had already written out in his own hand a Memorandum
dictated to him by Goldsmith himself &#8220;one rainy day at Northumberland
House&#8221; (28 April, 1773) giving dates and many interesting particulars
relating to his life, and this Memorandum is still in existence. Too much
importance must not be attached to it. Percy no doubt regarded it as a
Memorandum only, which might prove useful under future conditions
that had not then arisen, and how much of it is Goldsmith and how much
Percy must for ever remain unknown. The Statement was communicated
to Johnson; not used by him: returned by his executors to the wrong
person (Malone), sent by him to Percy, and apparently not used textually
by him for the purpose of his Memoir of his friend. In any case, there
is not much in it about the members of Oliver&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>Sir James Prior was ignorant of the existence of this Memorandum,
when preparing his <i>Life of Goldsmith</i> (Murray, 1837): but with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
praiseworthy carefulness, he set about whilst he was in Ireland in the
early part of the nineteenth century to dig up such particulars as he could
discover about Oliver&#8217;s parentage; and what he says concerning &#8220;the
Goldsmith Family&#8221; in his first Chapter is the fullest and most authoritative
history of the poet&#8217;s forebears that was capable of being written within
half a century of Goldsmith&#8217;s death and with the information at that time
available.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for present purposes to go further back than Oliver&#8217;s
grandfather, whose name was Robert Goldsmith of Ballyoughter (not John,
as in Dr. Percy&#8217;s Statement). The following facts are known about this
ancestor of the poet.</p>


<h3>1. ROBERT GOLDSMITH OF BALLYOUGHTER.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Grandfather.)</p>

<p>Robert, elder of two sons of the Revd. John Goldsmith, of Newton, Co.
Meath, and Jane Madden, of Donore, Co. Dublin, does not appear to have
gone to College or to have exercised any profession. He &#8220;married
Catherine, daughter of Thomas Crofton, D.D., Dean of Elphin, and settled
down at Ballyoughter, near the residence of his father-in-law&#8221; (Prior I, 5).
By his wife, &#8220;who enjoyed a moderate fortune, he had a family of thirteen
children, nine sons and four daughters.&#8221; Several of them died young.
John, the eldest son of Robert, &#8220;who had been educated at Trinity
College preparatory to studying for the bar, settled down on the family
property at Ballyoughter&#8221; (Prior I, 5). The second son Charles, who also
went to Trinity College, was the father of the poet (<i>see</i> § 2). One of the
daughters, Jane, married the Rev. Thomas Contarine of Oran (<i>see</i> § 4).</p>


<h3>2. THE REVD. CHARLES GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Father.)</p>

<p>Charles Goldsmith entered Trinity College as a pensioner on the
16 June, 1707. He was described in the Register as born and educated
&#8220;prope Elphin,&#8221; as the son of Robert, and as aged 17. He was born
therefore in 1690. His earlier career is obscure, but in a family Bible he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is described as &#8220;Charles Goldsmith of Ballyoughter&#8221; (the family residence)
and as &#8220;married to Mrs. Ann Jones ye 4th of May 1718&#8221; (Prior I, 14),
when therefore he was 28 years of age. &#8220;This union was not approved
by the friends of either: he was destitute of the means of providing for a
family, and the father of his wife having a son and three other daughters
to provide for, her portion was small&#8221; (Prior I, 7). Ann Jones was
daughter of the Revd. Oliver Jones of Smith Hill, master of the diocesan
school at Elphin, where Charles had received his preliminary education,
and where the attachment commenced. Her uncle, named Green, who
was rector of Kilkenny West, provided the young couple with a house
about six miles distant from himself, at a place called Pallas, in the
adjoining county of Longford. &#8220;Here they took up their abode, and
continued for a period of twelve years [1718 to 1730], Mr. Goldsmith
officiating partly in the church of his uncle, and partly in the parish in
which he resided.&#8221; At Pallas therefore five of their eight children
(including Oliver) were born: the other three were born at Lissoy, to
which the family removed in 1730, when Charles Goldsmith, by the death
of his wife&#8217;s uncle, succeeded to the Rectory of Kilkenny West.</p>

<p>The family Bible referred to by Prior (I, 14) records the names and
dates of birth of the several children as under: <i>Margaret</i>, born 22 August,
1719 (of whom nothing seems to be known); <i>Catherine</i>, born 13 January,
1721, married to Daniel Hodson (<i>see</i> § 5); <i>Jane</i>, born 9 February, 17<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
(<i>see</i> § 6); <i>Henry</i>, born 9 February, 17<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (<i>see</i> § 7); <i>Oliver</i>, born 10
November, 1728; <i>Maurice</i>, born 7 July, 1736 (<i>see</i> § 11); <i>Charles</i>, born
16 August, 1737 (<i>see</i> § 12); <i>John</i>, 1740 (to whom there is only the
briefest reference in Oliver&#8217;s letter to his uncle Contarine written from
Edinburgh at the close of 1753 and first printed by Prior in 1837
(I, 154): &#8220;How is my poor Jack Goldsmith? I fear his disorder is of
such a nature he won&#8217;t easily recover.&#8221; He is said by Percy (MS.
statement) to have &#8220;died young <i>aet.</i> 12.&#8221;)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>The loveable character of the Revd. Charles Goldsmith has been
depicted for all time in incomparable language in his wayward son&#8217;s works.
He is the father of &#8220;the man in black&#8221; of &#8220;the Citizen of the World,&#8221;
the preacher in &#8220;The Deserted Village&#8221; and Dr. Primrose in &#8220;the Vicar
of Wakefield.&#8221; He died suddenly early in 1747 in the fifty-seventh year
of his age (Prior I, 73), the induction of his successor, the Revd. Mr.
Wynne, taking place in March of that year.</p>

<div class="first">&#8220;Remote from towns he ran his goodly race</div>
<div class="verse">Nor e&#8217;er had changed, nor wished to change, his place.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>


<h3>3. ANN GOLDSMITH, <i>née</i> JONES.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Mother.)</p>

<p>The death of the Revd. Charles Goldsmith in 1747 made a considerable
change for the worse in the fortunes of his widow and her
children.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wealth of the family, never great or well husbanded, necessarily
suffered a serious diminution: the means of the widow were little more
than sufficient to provide the necessaries of life for the other branches of
the family: remittances to Oliver therefore ceased, and his prospects
became darker than ever&#8221; (Prior I, 73, 74).</p>

<p>Ann Goldsmith had to remove in her straitened circumstances to a
cottage at Ballymahon, and there Oliver seems to have idled away his time
between 1749 to 1751, when he drifted off with the intention of going to
America. Probably things were not made very comfortable for him at
home. Anyhow the mother appears to have been disgusted and disappointed
at his waywardness, and spoke to him sharply when he returned
penniless. He does not seem to have again resided at Ballymahon, but
to have gone to stay with his brother Henry, and afterwards with his
constant friend and benefactor, Uncle Contarine, before he went off to
Edinburgh, never to see his mother again. When writing from the
Scottish capital on 16 September, 1753, to his boon companion, Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Bryanton of Ballymahon, Oliver says in a postscript: &#8220;Give my service to
my mother if you see her: for as you express it in Ireland, I have a
sneaking kindness for her still.&#8221; After his return from his Continental
wanderings, he writes twice to his brother-in-law Daniel Hodson about his
mother. On 27 December, 1757, he says: &#8220;My mother too has lost
Pallas! My dear Sir, these things give me real uneasiness, and I should
wish to redress them.&#8221; And in November, 1758, he writes to Hodson:
&#8220;Pray tell me how my mother is since she will not gratify me herself and
tell me if in anything I can be immediately serviceable to her.&#8221; (This
and other similar phrases in the letters of 1757 and 1758 are omitted from
the 1801 publication as relating to &#8220;private family affairs.&#8221;) In Oliver&#8217;s
letter to his brother Henry of February, 1758, he says: &#8220;My mother I
am informed is almost blind: even tho I had the utmost inclination to
return home, I could not behold her in distress without a capacity of
relieving her from it, it would be too much to add to my present splenetic
habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later still in January, 1770, Oliver begs his brother Maurice to give
him particulars about the family: &#8220;Tell me about my mother, my brother
Hodson and his son, ... what is become of them, where they live and
what they do.&#8221; Mrs. Goldsmith died in Ireland later in the same year,
and in Mr. William Filby&#8217;s tailor&#8217;s bills against Goldsmith is the entry
of £5:12:0 for &#8220;a suit of mourning&#8221; (doubtless for her) dated
8 September, 1770 (Prior I, 233).</p>


<h3>4. THE CONTARINES.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Aunt, Uncle, and Cousin.)</p>

<p>As already stated, one of the daughters of Robert Goldsmith named
Jane married the Revd. Thomas Contarine, Vicar of Oran. She bore him
a daughter Jane, the playmate of Oliver&#8217;s childhood, and died in her
sixty-third year on the 12 June, 1744 (Prior I, 55, note). &#8220;Uncle
Contarine&#8221; was the best, kindest and most consistent friend of Oliver
Goldsmith in his boyhood and student days; and Oliver had a deep sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of gratitude to him. He wrote to Contarine two letters from Edinburgh
in 1753 (printed in Prior I, 145 and 154), and a third letter from Leyden
in 1754, which is fortunately preserved.</p>

<p>The following incident, illustrative of Oliver&#8217;s affection for his generous
uncle, is copied into the Memoir of 1801 (page 33) from Percy&#8217;s own
manuscript. Oliver had borrowed some money from an Irish friend at
Leyden &#8220;with which he determined to quit Holland and to visit the
adjacent countries. But unfortunately his curiosity led him to view a
garden, where the choicest flowers were reared for sale. Poor Goldsmith,
recollecting that his uncle was an admirer of such rarities, without
reflecting on the reduced state of his own finances, was tempted to
purchase some of these costly flower roots to be sent as a present to
Ireland, and thereby left himself so little cash that he is said to have
set out on his travels with only one clean shirt and no money in his
pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later Oliver wrote to Contarine&#8217;s daughter, Mrs. Lawder, on 15
August, 1758, from the Temple Exchange Coffee House an affectionate
letter apologising for his long silence, but explaining that he wrote to
Kilmore from Leyden, Louvain and Rouen and received no answer, and
referring thus to his uncle: &#8220;he is no more that soul of fire as when I
once knew him. His mind was too active an inhabitant not to disorder
the feeble mansion of its abode, for the richest jewels soonest wear their
settings. Yet who but a fool would lament his condition, he now forgets
the calamities of life, perhaps indulgent heaven has given him a foretaste
of that tranquillity here which he so well deserves hereafter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Contarine died a few months after the date of this letter, aged
about 74, and left Oliver a legacy of £15, which he eventually made over
to his impecunious brother Maurice. In announcing this decision (in
January, 1770) Oliver says to Maurice: &#8220;The kindness of that good couple
to our poor shattered family demands our sincerest gratitude, and though
they have almost forgot me yet if good things at last arrive, I hope one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
day to return, and encrease their good humour by adding to my own. I
have sent my cousin Jenny [Mrs. Lawder] a miniature picture of myself as
I believe it is the most acceptable present I can offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Contarine&#8217;s daughter Jane married James Lawder, a well-to-do resident
of Kilmore, near Carrick on Shannon. To her Oliver addressed on
15 August, 1758, the affectionate letter already quoted dwelling on the
past and signing himself &#8220;Your affectionate and obliged Kinsman.&#8221; It
seems to have provoked no reply.</p>

<p>The end of the Lawders was tragic. The husband was treacherously
murdered by his servants and labourers, who carried off the plate in the
house and about £300 in money. For this crime no less than six of
them were executed. The wife, who narrowly escaped being murdered
also, died in Dublin about 1790 (Prior I, 130, note).</p>


<h3>5. CATHERINE GOLDSMITH (MRS. DANIEL HODSON).</h3>

<p class="center">(Sister of Oliver.)</p>

<p>Catherine was born 13 January, 1721. It was her private marriage
with Daniel Hodson, &#8220;the son of a gentleman of good family residing at
St. John&#8217;s near Athlone,&#8221; who was at the time of the engagement a pupil of
Henry Goldsmith, that led to Oliver&#8217;s entering Trinity College as a sizar
instead of as a pensioner like Henry. Her father, the Revd. Charles
Goldsmith, was greatly indignant at this marriage, and in order to give his
daughter a marriage portion of £400, sacrificed his tithes and rented land.</p>

<p>To his brother-in-law Hodson, Oliver wrote two very cordial letters on
27 December, 1757, and November, 1758, the second containing a
paragraph: &#8220;Dear Sister, I wrote to Kilmore (the residence of the Lawders).
I wish you would let me know how that family stands affected with regard
to me.&#8221; It is curious that in Oliver&#8217;s letter to Maurice of January, 1770,
he does not ask after his sister Catherine, though he enquires about &#8220;my
mother, my brother Hodson and his son, my brother Harry&#8217;s son and
daughter&#8221; and other members of the family. After Oliver&#8217;s death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
however, Catherine Hodson, appealed to by Maurice, wrote out a full and
very sympathetic account, running to twelve foolscap pages, of Oliver&#8217;s
youthful adventures, terminating with his being sent to Edinburgh in 1753
&#8220;for the studdy of Physick. From this date I am a stranger to what
happened him: he wrote severall letters to his friends from Switzerland,
Germany and Italy.&#8221;</p>

<p>With reference to Oliver&#8217;s enquiry quoted above as to &#8220;my Brother
Hodson and his son,&#8221; it may be mentioned that the poet befriended this
nephew in London in 1772 to the extent of allowing him to run up a bill
for £35:3:0 with his tailor William Filby. It is to be feared this bill
was still unpaid at Oliver&#8217;s decease (Forster II, 173).</p>


<h3>6. JANE GOLDSMITH, AFTERWARDS JOHNSON.</h3>

<p class="center">(Born 9 February, 1722. Sister of Oliver.)</p>

<p>As the family Bible entries from which were copied into Prior&#8217;s <i>Life</i>
(I, 14) gave as the date of the births of Henry and Jane Goldsmith
the same day 9 February, 17&mdash; (leaf torn), Forster surmised and with
much plausibility that they were twins, born on the 9 February, 1722
(I, 9). Jane married one Johnson, a farmer at Athlone, and appears to
have written to Oliver in 1769 about her impoverished condition, which
Oliver in his letter to Maurice of January, 1770, regrets his inability
to relieve.</p>


<h3>7. THE REVD. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Elder Brother.)</p>

<p>Very little is known about the eldest son of the Revd. Charles
Goldsmith, Henry, who was born at Pallas on the 9 February, 1722
(Prior I, 14). He was educated at Dr. Neligan&#8217;s school at Elphin, afterwards
matriculating at Trinity College, Dublin, on 4 May, 1741 (Prior
I, 34, note). He was elected a scholar on Trinity Monday, 1743: &#8220;but
returning home in the succeeding vacation, flushed probably with his
recent triumph, he indulged a youthful passion and married&#8221; (Prior I, 35).</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>All that the Percy Memoir of 1801 (I, 3) says about Henry is: &#8220;Of his
eldest son the Revd. Henry Goldsmith, to whom his brother dedicated
<i>The Traveller</i>, their father had formed the most sanguine hopes, as he
had distinguished himself both at school and at College, but he unfortunately
married at the early age of nineteen: which confined him to
a Curacy, and prevented him rising to preferment in the Church.&#8221; As
he was born at Pallas in February, 1722, Henry must, if this statement
be accurate, have become a married man in 1741, about the time he
matriculated at Trinity College. There is evidently inaccuracy somewhere
as to Henry&#8217;s age, and it may be doubted whether his marriage took
place before or after his election as a scholar of his College on Trinity
Monday, 1743. From some guarded words used by Prior (the most
painstaking investigator into the family history) it is possible the marriage
was a secret one, as Prior suggests that when it took place &#8220;he must have
been three years older [than stated above], or have formed this
connexion previous to entering the University. To some men this tie
becomes a stimulus to exertion: to others it seems a clog upon every
effort at rising in life&#8221; (I, 35). Prior seems to decide that in Henry&#8217;s
case it was a clog. He speaks of Henry having &#8220;indulged a youthful
passion and married,&#8221; and continues shortly afterwards: &#8220;Finding
residence in College no longer eligible, the advantages of his scholarship
were sacrificed: he retired, as appears from the college books, to the
country: established a school in his father&#8217;s neighbourhood: and in this
occupation added to that of curate at &#8216;forty pounds a year,&#8217; though
possessed of talents and character, he passed the remainder of life.&#8221;
(Prior I, 35.)</p>

<p>It is nowhere very clearly stated, that it would seem that Henry acted
as curate to his father at Kilkenny West, and perhaps after his father&#8217;s
death in 1747 he continued in office under the new Rector, the Revd.
Mr. Wynne (Prior I, 73). John Forster says (I, 427): &#8220;In his early life
Dr. Strean succeeded Henry Goldsmith in the curacy of Kilkenny West,
which the latter occupied at the period of his death (1768) and as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
careful to tell us, in its emoluments of £40 a year, which was not only his
salary but continued to be the same when I [Strean] a successor, was
appointed to that parish.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two brothers Henry and Oliver had a strong and abiding affection
for one another. Oliver had corresponded with his brother whilst he was
abroad, though none of his letters have been preserved. Part of <i>The
Traveller</i> had been sent to Henry from Switzerland, and when it was
completed and published at the end of 1764, the poem was dedicated to
him. The opening paragraph contained this sentence: &#8220;It will throw a
light upon many parts of it when the reader understands that it is
addressed to a man who, despising fame and fortune, has retired early to
happiness and obscurity, with an income of forty pounds a year.&#8221; And
the opening lines of the poem itself contain the familiar phrase:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Where&#8217;er I roam, whatever realms to see,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;My heart untravelled fondly turns to thee:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Still to my brother turns, with ceaseless pain</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And drags at each remove a lengthening chain.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Later on there is the well-known description of the village preacher:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;A man he was to all the country dear,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And passing rich with forty pounds a year.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>There is only one letter from Oliver to Henry known to exist: that
addressed &#8220;about 1759&#8221; to Henry at &#8220;Lowfield, near Ballymore in
Westmeath Ireland&#8221; seeking his assistance in the disposal of copies of
his book on &#8220;Polite learning&#8221; describing his own physical looks, giving
Henry advice as to the education of his son, asking about his mother and
other members of the family, and ending up: &#8220;by telling you what you
very well know already, that I am your most affectionate friend and brother
Oliver Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry was the subject of Oliver&#8217;s solicitude when he was granted an
interview with the Earl of Northumberland (Dr. Percy&#8217;s friend) who was
about to proceed to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant. We owe the report of
this interview to the unsympathetic pen of Sir John Hawkins in his <i>Life of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<i>Johnson</i> (p. 419). In answer to the Earl&#8217;s remark that he was going to
Ireland and hearing that Goldsmith was a native of that country he would
be glad to do him any kindness, Oliver is made to reply: &#8220;I would say
nothing but that I had a brother there, a clergyman, that stood in need of
help.&#8221; Hawkins&#8217; sour comment was: &#8220;thus did this idiot in the affairs of
the world trifle with his fortunes and put back the hand that was held out
to assist him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Revd. Henry Goldsmith died at Athlone at the end of May, 1768,
at the age of forty-five. A suit of mourning for him ordered of Oliver&#8217;s
tailor William Filby cost £5:12:6 (Forster II, 113). The brother
seems to have at once written a letter of affectionate sympathy with the
family&mdash;probably to the widow, and to his nephew Henry he sent a
separate letter which has only just come to light in North America, having
doubtless been preserved till now by descendants of the original recipient.
It is now the property of Mr. William Harris Arnold of Nutley, New
Jersey, to whose kindness I owe permission for its reproduction:</p>

<p>My dear Henry,</p>

<p>Your dear father&#8217;s death has afflicted me deeply. The news of this dreadful
event only reached me yesterday and though I have already sent my love and condolences
in a letter which you will see I pen this further line to my dear Nephew to express the
hope that you and your Brother, young as you both are, will bear yourselves as the sons
of such a man should. As to your own future I shall not rest until I hit upon some
means of serving you; and it may be that through the influence of some of my friends
here you may procure a situation suited to your talents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile attend diligently to your studies, neglect nothing that can advance your
interest when an opening occurs. Are you still inclined towards a military career?
That would necessitate, besides a certain temper and constitution, a considerable sum
of ready money. Something, however, might be managed abroad&mdash;in the Indies or
in America.</p>

<p>Let me hear from you, my dear Henry, and with much love to you both</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">Believe me,</span><br />
<span class="indentright">Your affectionate Uncle,</span><br />
Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Goldsmith<br />
<span class="indent">In Care of Mrs. Hodson,</span><br />
<span class="indent2">Athlone,</span><br />
<span class="indent3">Ireland.</span></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>I find no mention whatever in any document (published or unpublished)
that I have come across of a second son of the Revd. Henry. Oliver at
the time of his brother&#8217;s death was at work on the <i>Deserted Village</i> at a
summer retreat in a cottage eight miles from the Edgware Road (Forster
II, 124), was visited there in May, 1768, by Cooke, who marks the date
as exactly two years before the poem appeared in print (May, 1770), and
tells us that the writing of it, and its elaborate revision, extended over the
whole interval of twenty-four months.</p>

<p>Is it permissible to suggest that Oliver, with his head full of other
things, was a little dubious about the sex of the other child of his brother,
and spoke of a son where he should have said daughter? Writing to his
brother Maurice in January, 1770, with anxious enquiries about the several
members of the family, Oliver says: &#8220;Tell me about my mother, my brother
Hodson and his son: <i>my brother Harry&#8217;s son and daughter</i>, my sister
Johnson, the family of Ballyoughter, what is become of them, where they
live and how they do. You talked of being my only brother, I don&#8217;t
understand you&mdash;Where is Charles?&#8221; (<i>Memoir</i>, p. 89.)</p>

<p>Here it will be observed, Oliver makes tender enquiries after Henry&#8217;s
&#8220;son and daughter.&#8221; He says nothing of the widow or of a second son.
In the only letter of Oliver&#8217;s to his brother that is now extant, ascribed by
Percy to &#8220;about 1759,&#8221; Oliver thus refers to the son: &#8220;The reasons you
have given me for breeding your son a scholar are judicious and
convincing.... Preach then my dear Sir, to your son not the excellence
of human nature nor the disrespect of riches, but endeavour to teach him
thrift and economy. Let his poor wandering Uncle&#8217;s example be placed
in his eyes. I had learned from books to love virtue, before I was taught
from experience the necessity of being selfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>I quote from the original holograph letter, not from the somewhat
bowdlerised version of it that Percy printed in the <i>Memoir</i> of 1801, and
that has since been copied in all subsequent biographies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>It remains therefore to consider what happened to those whom Henry
left behind him in 1768 of whom there is any record. There was a widow,
of whose parentage and maiden name, or of the circumstances of her
widowhood nothing seems to be known, his son Henry, and his daughter
Catherine.</p>


<h3>8. HENRY GOLDSMITH&#8217;S WIDOW.</h3>

<p>It was in all probability Mrs. Henry Goldsmith of whom Johnson wrote
to George Steevens on 25 February, 1777, as recorded by Boswell in
Volume III, Chapter III:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Steevens ... joined Dr. Johnson in Kind assistance to a female relation of
Dr. Goldsmith, and desired that on her return to Ireland she would procure authentic
particulars of the life of her relation. Concerning her is the following letter:</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">&#8220;To George Steevens Esq.</span><br />

&#8220;February 25th 1777.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Sir,</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be glad to hear that from Mrs. Goldsmith whom we lamented as
drowned, I have received a letter full of gratitude to us all, with promises to make the
enquiries which we recommended to her. You will tell the good news,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright3">&#8220;I am, Sir,</span><br />

<span class="indentright">&#8220;Your most etc.</span><br />

&#8220;Sam Johnson.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Prior (II, 562) expands this incident, assigning it definitely to the
widow of the Revd. Henry, but gives no new facts, except to add that
&#8220;being but slenderly provided for, she accepted the situation of Matron
to the Meath Infirmary at Navan.&#8221;</p>


<h3>9. HENRY, SON OF THE REVD. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Nephew.)</p>

<p>Henry, the son, Prior describes as &#8220;distinguished for spirit, intelligence
and personal beauty.... A commission being obtained for him in the
army, he quitted Ireland for North America about the year 1782.&#8221; A
constant friend and correspondent of his, the Revd. Thomas Handcock
wrote on 7 October, 1799 (Prior II, 564) that Henry had been a lieutenant
in the 54th Regiment, and that &#8220;with an uncommon flow of spirits (he)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
possesses a large portion of his uncle&#8217;s genius.&#8221; He married an American
lady from Rhode Island and &#8220;after the peace settled with her somewhere
in Nova Scotia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He plunged through unheard of distresses and difficulties until very
lately, when accident made our young Prince, the Duke of Kent,
acquainted with his person and history: and His Royal Highness lost
no time in raising him, a wife and ten children, considerably above want,
as I learn by a letter from Goldsmith within these last six weeks. I
had ... received his rent and managed his affairs, and in his distresses
he often urged me to sell his interest in the Deserted Village [Lissoy]
which I continued to avoid, to his present very great satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The particular way in which Henry Goldsmith&#8217;s needs were brought
under the notice of the Duke of Kent is not recorded, but His Royal
Highness had been sent to Canada in 1791, and was Commander-in-Chief
of the forces in British North America in 1799-1800. What Mr.
Handcock says in his letter is confirmed by an unpublished letter written
by Henry&#8217;s sister Catherine to Bishop Percy on 6 January, 1802, apropos
of her uncle Charles&#8217; statement to the Bishop that &#8220;the name is extinct
except in his family&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;He never considered,&#8221; said she, &#8220;that I had cousins in this country
that had male heirs, as also a much lov&#8217;d brother now residing at Halifax
in North America, who has ten children, and has either four or five sons
lawfully by an amiable wife. From my brother&#8217;s account, his Children
possess uncommon abilities. His eldest son Henry he intends for the
Bar: his second son is a midshipman, and his third son Oliver, he
mention&#8217;d in a letter to me he would have educated in Ireland. The
Duke of Kent, my brother&#8217;s particular Patron and Friend, has got him
the place of Assistant Engineer at Halifax, and means to provide for him
in a better way when opportunity offers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A letter by Henry Goldsmith to a kinsman dated 20 March, 1808,
brings the story of this Nova Scotian family up to a somewhat later date.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;I am fixed here in the Commissariat Department and have a family
of nine children, five sons and four daughters. The eldest Henry,
follows the profession of the law: Hugh Colvill is I hope ere this, a
lieutenant in the Navy: Oliver is with a merchant at Boston: Charles
is a midshipman on this station, and Benjamin a boy. The daughters
Ann, Catherine, Eliza and Jane are at home with me, and promise to be
all I wish them.&#8221; (Prior II, 568.)</p>

<p>Hugh Colvill Goldsmith (1789-1841) referred to in his father&#8217;s letter,
merits a passing mention as being the young sailor who on 8 April,
1824, shocked Cornish susceptibilities by displacing the famous rocking
Logan Stone at the Land&#8217;s End, and had to arrange for its replacement
later in that year (29 October to 2 November) in its original position,
which as the weight of the stone is variously given as 60 to 80 tons, was
no easy matter. Doubtless because of this foolhardy exploit, he has a
niche in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, being in fact the only
member of the Goldsmith family other than the poet who is thus honoured.
He was born at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, on 2 April, 1789, and
was at the time of the Logan Rock incident a Naval Lieutenant in
command of the &#8220;Nimble&#8221; revenue cutter off the coast of Cornwall. He
was never promoted, and died at sea off St. Thomas in the West Indies
on 8 October, 1841. An incidental reference to Charles Goldsmith (also
referred to in his father&#8217;s letter of 1808 as a midshipman) shows that he
was afterwards a Commander in the Navy. His dates are 1795-1854.</p>


<h3>10. CATHERINE, DAUGHTER OF THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Niece.)</p>

<p>The facts as to the daughter of Henry Goldsmith are easier to piece
together, as Bishop Percy drew up when in London in July, 1800, a
memorandum as to her case which has fortunately been preserved in
manuscript, and gives incidentally some particulars as to other members
of the Goldsmith family.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>There are a number of pitiful letters from this poor little lonely and
suffering soul addressed to the Bishop at dates ranging from 1794 to
March, 1803, with drafts of two of the Bishop&#8217;s replies, mercifully modified
before despatch, referring to his monetary advances already made to her,
and speaking of the &#8220;constant source of plague and vexation&#8221; which the
question of the publication of the <i>Memoir</i> had been to him. The end
came in July, 1803, when one McDonnell wrote to the Bishop&#8217;s secretary
that Catherine had died &#8220;after a painful illness to which her dependant
and helpless situation must have greatly contributed.&#8221; McDonnell had
seen to her being decently buried, and thought 8 or 9 guineas would
reimburse the total cost. No doubt the Bishop sent him this.</p>


<h3>11. MAURICE GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Brother.)</p>

<p>Maurice, the next child of the Revd. Charles Goldsmith after Oliver,
was born on 7 July, 1736, and was followed a year later (16 August, 1737)
by Charles, and in 1740 by a fourth son John. Maurice was not therefore,
as stated erroneously in a note on page 86 of the Percy <i>Memoir</i> &#8220;our
poet&#8217;s youngest brother.&#8221; He first emerges from obscurity early in 1770,
when he was in his thirty-fourth year, and wrote to Oliver a letter from the
Lawder&#8217;s house at Kilmore asking for assistance. Oliver&#8217;s reply has
fortunately been preserved. It bears no date, but Percy ascribes it to
&#8220;January 1770,&#8221; which is about right, as endorsed upon it is Maurice&#8217;s
receipt dated 4 February, 1770, £15, the amount of a legacy left by
Uncle Contarine to Oliver which he made over to his brother (I, 89).</p>

<p>According to Prior (II, 519), Sir Joshua Reynolds undertook after the
death of the poet on 4 April, 1774, &#8220;to superintend his affairs until the
arrival from Ireland of such of his relatives as should be authorised to
receive them.&#8221; For answer Maurice Goldsmith appeared in London &#8220;a
plain unlettered man, too homely it seems in appearance and manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to command much consideration from his late brother&#8217;s accomplished
friends&#8221; (Prior II, 524). The still surviving Mrs. Gwyn (the &#8220;Jessamy
Bride&#8221;) told Prior long years after that:</p>

<p>&#8220;Being in a small party in the house of Sir Joshua when the latter was
summoned downstairs, he returned after a considerable absence and
whispered her that he had been below with Goldsmith&#8217;s brother, but
thinking a little beer or spirits there better adapted to his taste than tea
in the drawing room, he had entertained him in what he considered the
most appropriate manner. She, with the usual kindness of her sex,
thought his behaviour scarcely becoming in the President to so near a
relative of his departed friend.&#8221; (II, 524.)</p>

<p>Doubtless it was at this time that Sir Joshua gave Maurice the
subjoined (undated) note of introduction to the &#8220;Revd. Dr. Percy
Northumberland House&#8221; still preserved amongst the Percy papers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Joshua Reynolds&#8217;s compliments and begs leave to introduce to
Dr. Percy Mr. Goldsmith brother of his late friend Dr. Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the next of kin, Maurice was entitled to administer his brother&#8217;s
affairs, and there is at Somerset House the formal Probate granted on
28 June, 1774, to &#8220;Maurice Goldsmith, the natural and lawful brother and
next of kin to the said deceased.&#8221; As Oliver died in debt, there was
nothing for Maurice to administer or receive, and he left London on
10 June, 1774, writing to Mr. Hawes, the apothecary who attended his
brother, his &#8220;most sincere thanks for your kind behaviour to me since my
arrival here,&#8221; and for his &#8220;care, assiduity and diligence with respect to
my brother Doctor Goldsmith.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt Percy improved the occasion, when Maurice came to see him
at Northumberland House with Sir Joshua&#8217;s note of introduction in his
pocket, by giving him some sound advice, with perhaps a cash contribution
on account, and certainly with an admonition to collect all his brother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
letters to members of the family in Ireland that he could manage to pick
up. For on 15 July, 1776, Maurice wrote to Percy as under:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">July 15, 1776.</p>

<p>Revd. Sir,</p>

<p>When I last had the honour of seeing you at your Chambers in Northumberland
House you most kindly told me you wod willingly serve me, I have Sir according to
your Order collected in this Country all the Letters and a few anecdotes of my Brother,
the late Dr. Goldsmith that I cod procure which I assure you Sir are entirely Jenuine,
the Anecdotes wrote by his Sister who ware both inseperable Companions in their youth.</p>

<p>I am much concernd that two of these Letters which I send are not entirely Legibl
and that it will cost som pains to make them and the Memoirs fitt for the press; So
Dr Sir to your goodness and protection I commit them thoroughly satisfied you will
serve the Brother of a Man who really lovd and Esteemd you.</p>

<p>I can assure you Sir I have gon several Miles to collect them and as my circumstances
at present are not very affluent a small assistance wod be gratefully accepted, shd any
accrue from these papers wich with what my good Friend Sr. Joshua Reynolds and
Mr. Garrick promisd to supply, will not be deemd I hope unworthy of yr publication
which you and Sir Joshua told me you wod get affected.</p>

<p>I am Sir with the greatest respect Sir your verry Obet. Humble Servant</p>

<p class="right">Maurice Goldsmith</p>

<p>I hope you will do me the honour to let me know if you receivd. these by directing
to me at Charles Town near Elphin Ireland.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing to show that anything definite followed this appeal for
money: and perhaps on that account, Maurice next addressed himself to
Dr. Johnson, to whom he wrote at Bolt Court an undated letter bearing
the Elphin post-mark as under:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="indent">&#8220;To Doctor Johnson at his house in Bolt Court Fleet Street London.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I lately had the Honour to receive a letter from my good Friend the Revd.
Docr. Percy, who from som Papers I had sent him did intend writing the life of the
Late Docr. Goldsmith: he tells me that from the esteem you have had for the poor
Docr. you have determind to take the work under your protection and that you had
also promised to use your interest with the booksellers to let one impression be printed
of all his poetical writings.... Your taking the trouble to write and set of(f) the
life of the Docr. by your able judicious and highly esteemed pen will be a lasting
honour to his memory and to his Family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In a note to the print of Oliver&#8217;s letter to Maurice of &#8220;January 1770,&#8221;
Percy gives the following further information about Maurice (p. 86).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
&#8220;Having been bred to no business, he upon some occasion complained to
our bard, that he found it difficult to live like a gentleman, on which
Oliver begged he would, without delay, quit so unprofitable a trade and
betake himself to some handycraft employment. Maurice wisely took the
hint, and bound himself apprentice to a cabinet maker. He had a shop in
Dublin, when the Duke of Rutland was Lord Lieutenant: who at the
instance of Mr. Orde, then principal secretary of state (now Lord Bolton)
out of regard to his brother&#8217;s memory, made him an inspector of the
licences in that city. He was also appointed mace-bearer on the erection
of the Royal Irish Academy: both of them places very compatible with his
business. In the former he gave proof of great integrity by detecting a
fraud committed on the revenue in his department, by which probably he
might himself have profited, if he had not been a man of principle. He
died without issue, about seven years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Maurice died early in the winter of 1792-3, as
appears from a letter written by Dr. Thomas Campbell, who first attempted
Oliver&#8217;s biography, to the Bishop of Dromore&mdash;then in London&mdash;on 12
June, 1793 (Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary Illustrations</i>, VII, 790). Campbell says:
&#8220;Alas! poor Maurice, He is to receive no comfort from your Lordship&#8217;s
labours in his behalf. He departed from a miserable life early last winter,
and luckily has left no children: but he has left a widow, and faith a very
nice one, who called on me one of the few days I spent in Dublin after
Christmas, so that you will not want claimants.&#8221;</p>

<p>The numerous letters from Maurice to the Bishop which have been
preserved appear to show that he had really made sustained efforts to
collect in Ireland such of the original letters written by Oliver to his
relatives as were procurable. One such letter, and that of the greatest
interest, viz.: the letter written to Uncle Contarine from Leyden in 1754
was not retrieved until nine years after the letter of 15 July, 1776, already
quoted, for Maurice writes to the Bishop on 9 June, 1785, &#8220;I send your
Lordship a letter from my brother to his Uncle Contarine dated from Lydon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Vol. VIII of Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary Illustrations</i> (published in 1858)
contains at pp. 236-240, extracts from correspondence between the Bishop
and Edmund Malone from which it appears that on 16 June, 1785, Percy
was urging that the Members of the Club (of which Oliver was an original
Member) should show &#8220;our regard for the departed Bard by relieving his
only brother, and so far as I hear, the only one of his family that wants
relief.&#8221; (This was by no means the case, as Percy was afterwards to learn
by bitter experience.) He wrote again to Malone on 17 October, 1786,
&#8220;I must entreat you to exert all your influence among the gentlemen of
The Club, and particularly urge it on Sir Joshua Reynolds, to procure
subscriptions for the relief of poor Maurice Goldsmith, who is suffering
great penury and distress being not only poor but very unhealthy....
A guinea a piece from the members of the Club would be a great
relief to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maurice&#8217;s subsequent appointment in 1787 as the Mace-bearer to the
Royal Irish Academy and his place in the Licence Office appears to have
eased somewhat the final years of his chequered life, but when he died in
1792, a new appeal for the Bishop&#8217;s help came from his widow, Esther
Goldsmith.</p>


<h3>11<i>a</i>. ESTHER GOLDSMITH, WIDOW OF MAURICE.</h3>

<p>All that is known about her is that she is described in a Petition to the
Lord Lieutenant (the draft of which in Percy&#8217;s writing was left amongst his
papers) as &#8220;the daughter of a respectable clergyman,&#8221; and as &#8220;left wholly
destitute&#8221; by the death of her husband Maurice Goldsmith. She got
various grants from a fund in the gift of the Lord Lieutenant known as the
Concordatum, and on the last page of Prior&#8217;s <i>Life</i> (Vol. II, 576) is a letter
from her dated Rushport, Elphin, 19 June, 1793, to Mr. J. C. Walker
asking his influence in favour of her appointment as housekeeper to the
Royal Irish Academy.</p>

<p>There are two unpublished later letters (1794) from Rushport to Bishop
Percy, in one of which Esther wants to know about the subscription to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<i>Memoir</i>, and in the other she thanks the Bishop for £15 which she had
received from the Concordatum Fund. A later letter dated 17 October,
1801, from Catherine, daughter of the Revd. Henry Goldsmith, to the
Bishop seems to show that Esther had remarried. &#8220;She thinks she is as
well entitled to the money arising from the publication of my Uncle&#8217;s
works as I am, but there I must beg leave to differ in opinion with her.&#8221;
Catherine gives some more particulars which she thinks the Bishop ought
to know, but &#8220;if Mrs. Goldsmith knew the information came to your
Lordship through me, &#8217;twou&#8217;d bring her tongue upon me, which she can
use well.&#8221;</p>


<h3>12. CHARLES GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p class="center">(Oliver&#8217;s Brother.)</p>

<p>Charles Goldsmith (born 1717, died 1805) the youngest but one of the
Revd. Charles Goldsmith&#8217;s children, comes on the scene earlier than the
others. Encouraged by the accounts which had reached Ireland of his
brother Oliver&#8217;s arrival in England and growing literary fame, he ventured
to the Metropolis in the year 1757, and as Northcote says in his <i>Life of
Reynolds</i> (I, 332-3): &#8220;Having heard of his brother Noll mixing in the
first society in London, he took it for granted that his fortune was made,
and that he could soon make a brother&#8217;s also: he therefore left home
without notice: but soon found, on his arrival in London, that the picture
he had formed of his brother&#8217;s situation was too highly coloured, that Noll
could not introduce him to his great friends, and in fact that, although out
of a jail, he was often out of a lodging.&#8221;</p>

<p>The garret where Goldsmith then wrote and slept is supposed to have
been one of the courts near Salisbury Square. His letters were addressed
from the neighbouring Temple-exchange coffee-house near Temple Bar,
and the secret of the lodging is said to have been won from the coffee-house
waiter &#8220;George&#8221; to whom Charles Goldsmith confided his
relationship. (Forster I, 124.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Thus disappointed, Charles quitted London in a few days, suddenly
and secretly as he had entered it, &#8220;in a humble capacity it is said, for
Jamaica&#8221;: whence says Forster (I, 125) &#8220;he did not return till after four-and-thirty
years to tell this anecdote, and to be described by Malone as not
a little like his celebrated brother in person, speech and manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Charles came back to this country in 1791 it was to arrange for
his ultimate settlement with his family in England: but after the peace of
Amiens (1802), he sold his house, and with his wife (a Creole), a daughter
and a son named Oliver (born in England), migrated to the South of
France. In consequence of Buonaparte&#8217;s order for detaining British
subjects, he again returned to England in 1803 by way of Holland, much
reduced in circumstances, and died about 1805 at humble lodgings in
Ossulston Street, Somers Town.</p>

<p>In an original letter of Charles himself, dated 2 September, 1795, in the
Percy bundle of Goldsmithiana, he says specifically: &#8220;I paid in 1791 a
visit to my native country: on my arrival I found the greatest part of my
relations and old friends had paid the debt of Nature: my brother Maurice
remained: he gave me a pleasing account of the great benefits you had
been pleased to bestow on him.&#8221; As Maurice had died, Charles put in a
plea for help for himself in view of the necessity of supporting &#8220;a wife and
five children.&#8221; These were of course the offspring of his Jamaica marriage
with a Creole, and Charles said nothing about any former marriage. Percy
is not known to have answered the letter: but on 8 December, 1801,
Charles made another appeal. Before answering this the Bishop made
some cautious enquiries of another member of the family, Catherine,
daughter of the Revd. Henry, who was already (since 1794) a candidate
for his charity. She replied on 28 December, 1801, that &#8220;there are some
parts of his [Charles&#8217;] letter true, and many others not so. He is indeed a
most delightful companion, abounds with wit and humour, and is perfectly
the gentleman, but he does not possess the steadiness or benevolent heart
that my much respected father or Uncle Oliver did. At the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I think he has a much better claim than my Uncle Maurice&#8217;s widow, for
she was left a very handsome fortune of near two hundred a year, and more
than a thousand pounds in ready money. I think she has no title at all
to receive anything from the sale of the Poems.&#8221; Later, Catherine wrote
again to the Bishop on 6 January, 1802, saying she had information that
her Uncle (Charles) &#8220;had a great deal of money in the Funds, that he
had some children and the most of them natural children. I assure you,
my Lord, he has a great deal of art and duplicity.&#8221; Percy wrote Charles
in 1802 some sort of letter, which the latter says he never received. This
was very possibly the case, in view of his migration to France after the
peace of Amiens.</p>

<p>Through the exertions of Edmund Malone, Charles was discovered to
be back in London, and he wrote to the Bishop in 1803 some details of
his experiences in France, following this up later in 1804 with a fuller
statement which is very readable and quite interesting.</p>

<p>The last letter preserved from Charles Goldsmith is dated 24 March,
1805, and is in a shaky hand, saying he is afraid &#8220;my poor little son Oliver
will soon be left fatherless and without a friend.&#8221; Probably Charles died
soon after, and according to the letter of a neighbour, Mr. R. C. Roffe,
dated 12 February, 1821, &#8220;almost in a state of second childhood. His
wife, with a son (Oliver) he had by her in England, went to the West
Indies&#8221;: and according to a quotation given by Prior (II, 574) from a
Jamaica newspaper, this Oliver died at Belmont on 21 October, 1828, in
the thirty-second year of his age.</p>

<p>It must be added to the above that before Percy had heard from
Charles, he had in 1794 received a letter from one John Goldsmith, a
sergeant of the South Cork Militia, claiming to be Charles&#8217;s son. At first
Percy evidently thought the man an impostor. On one of John&#8217;s letters
the Bishop had pencilled &#8220;natural son of Charles Goldsmith,&#8221; and has
marked as &#8220;not true&#8221; a story of the marriage of his parents by &#8220;my uncle
Henry Goldsmith, who was then Rector of the Parish they lived in,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the reception of such parents by the grandmother Ann Goldsmith and
Catherine Hodson his aunt. John told the Bishop on 2 October, 1808,
&#8220;I did not imagine my father Charles Goldsmith was in existence, as I did
not either see or hear from him since I saw your Lordship in Dublin in the
year 1793, nor did I ever hear of his being married a second time.&#8221; As
there are amongst the Percy papers receipts dated in October, 1808, May,
1809, and September, 1810, for a total of £35 in all for money disbursed
by the Bishop for the benefit of this John Goldsmith, Percy may have
considered there was something in his story after all.</p>

<p>As to what subsequently happened to this John Goldsmith and the
eight children on whose behalf he appealed to the generosity of Dr. Percy,
there seems to be no information available, but Prior (II, 574) mentions
that &#8220;a person named Goldsmith, and claiming to be a nephew of the
poet, died in the Cholera Hospital in Bristol in 1833: he was in a state of
destitution and may have had no just right to the honour he assumed.&#8221;
He may have been this John Goldsmith, son (legitimate or otherwise) of
Charles Goldsmith.</p>


<h3>THE PROFITS OF THE PERCY MEMOIR.</h3>

<p>The original design of Bishop Percy in undertaking the <i>Memoir</i> of his
friend Goldsmith was to benefit Maurice. Then Catherine, daughter of
Henry, was added as a participant in the assumed profits: afterwards (when
Maurice died and Charles revealed himself) Charles Goldsmith, the sole
then remaining brother of Oliver. Percy&#8217;s ultimate decision, when the
work took shape and he had made his agreement with Cadell and Davies
in 1797, was for 125 of the 250 free copies of the work given to him by
Cadell and Davies for disposal to be sold through White the bookseller of
Fleet Street for the benefit of Charles, and the remaining 125 copies to be
sold through Archer the bookseller of Dublin for the benefit of Catherine,
daughter of the Revd. Henry. The London copies seem to have gone off
fairly well. Percy in a Memorandum dated Dromore, 24 May, 1808,
explaining the affair long after the event to Dr. R. Anderson (<i>Literary</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<i>Illustrations</i>, VII, 189-192), says that from Charles &#8220;the Bishop frequently
heard, informing him that the payments were duly made, and whatever
copies he desired were delivered to him to dispose of among his friends
for his own benefit. He believes Mr. Charles Goldsmith is since dead,
but the account is still open with his family, to whom Mr. White must
account for any that may have remained of the 125 copies delivered to
him.&#8221; The case of the 125 Irish copies was less satisfactory. &#8220;It was
principally on account of Catherine Goldsmith, who had been reduced to
indigence, that the Bishop had applied in 1800 to Messrs. Cadell and
Davies to afford some present relief, to alleviate the distress occasioned
by the delay of the publication: which being refused by them, the Bishop
had supplied the same himself, and continued to do so till her death,
which took place before Mr. Archer had come to a settlement for the 125
copies transmitted to him. Part of these are still unsold.... Whatever
arises from this sale, or remains of Mr. Archer&#8217;s balance that was unpaid
to or for the niece, shall be delivered to any relative of Dr. Goldsmith
who shall be found a proper object of the same.&#8221; (Nichols&#8217; <i>Literary
